                    <h2>The Overview</h2>
                    <p>The objective for this project is to improve a pre-existing microinteraction, 
                        or to design and develop a unique microinteraction that can be used to improve 
                        the web. In a 10 week timeframe, I designed and developed 3 microinteractions - 
                        each of which built on top of the last. I chose to go the route of creating a unique 
                        interaction instead of improving a pre-existing one. I worked on a figma design file to 
                        design each of the interactions, and once they were designed I moved over to visual studio 
                        code to develop them. The final product is an image gallery that can open and close whenever a user
                        clicks on a button. This project is successful because the final product is a unique microinteraction 
                        that can be used to improve websites with image galleries.</p>

                        <p>I was tasked with designing and developing a complex microinteraction, which would improve some 
                            sort of feature that could be on a website. The given timeframe was 10 weeks, and I built up to 
                            the final complex microinteraction by experimenting and developing smaller, less-complex interactions. </p>

                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>This project exists to experiment with different microinteractions. You could take the approach of 
                            improving a pre-existing interaction, or develop your own unique interaction. The project as a whole 
                            seeks to solve the issue of either boring, poorly designed, or uneventful microinteractions across the web.</p>

                        <p>This project can be defined as successful if it has either improved a pre-existing microinteraction, or if the 
                            developer creates a unique interaction that can be used to improve the web.</p>

                                    <p>This is my first experimentation with creating a microinteraction. This design consists of a single image, with no other content. However, 
                                    when a user hovers over an image, the image darkens slightly while text fades in and moves up from the bottom of that image. I designed this 
                                    because I feel it could help companies to organize and display information differently.</p>

                                    <h4>Beta Designs</h4>
                                    <p>This microinteraction builds off of the alpha interaction. When a user hovers over the “Drexel University” image, the 
                                    title slides up to show more information describing the title, along with a “Gallery” button on the right. Upon clicking 
                                    the gallery button, more images appear in a grid format. This microinteraction is an image gallery which users can expand 
                                    and contract as they need. Once the image gallery is open, the text and color on the “Gallery” button changes. It is now a 
                                    red button which says “Close”. Clicking it closes the gallery. I designed this because I feel that some websites have content 
                                    that some users don’t necessarily want taking up space on their screen, so having the option to expand or contract content gives 
                                    users a choice to view or hide content that they are not interested in.</p>

                                    <h4>Final Designs</h4>
                                    <p>I had come pretty far with my image gallery idea, so I figured I’d stick with it for the final microinteraction. This 
                                    interaction builds off of the beta microinteraction, and works the same way. Hovering over the first image causes the 
                                    text to slide up, as well as a button which opens the image gallery when clicked. However, instead of just opening and 
                                    closing an image gallery, the user now has the option to click on any of the images that have just appeared. Upon doing 
                                    this, a modal will pop up, showing a larger version of the clicked image, as well as a title for the image. Clicking the “X”, 
                                    or clicking out of the picture causes it to fade away. I designed this interaction to improve the look, feel, and functionality 
                                    of "pop-out” image galleries.</p>

                        identical to how I designed it, and is completely functional. The only issue I had was sizing/organizing the modals on 
                        mobile, but I overcame this by giving them a fixed positioning, so they always appeared in the middle of the screen no 
                        matter where the user clicked.</p>

                    <p>Overall, I’d say that this project was a success. I accomplished what I set out to do, which was to design and develop a 
                        microinteraction that can be used to improve the web. It is compatible on mobile devices as well, which means it can be 
                        viewed from basically any device and still look good and work efficiently. I’m happy with the outcome of this project.</p>
